Since I first began taking the train to and from work in 1994, I’ve had brief relationships with portable CD players, a Rio and a couple of iPods, but I’m fairly ritualistic about my commute, and “no music” seems to be a constant.</p><p>I assume some of the need for the pre- and post-work mixture of silence, white noise, conversation and machinery comes from the fact that I listen to music most of the day while working, especially when editing. More recently, it stems from my logistic positioning in the workplace, which has me sitting in a windowless office on a side of the 14th floor that once housed 13 people, but is now home to no more than five. There is little, if any, noise. And while I venture from my office often to talk to people, there’s no constant conversation in the background. Some days, that’s fine. But other days – most days – it’s kind of depressing and somewhat annoying, hence the need for <a href="http://headphones.My" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">headphones.My</a> commute is a different story. I welcome the noise. In fact, I look forward to it. As far as my commuting rituals, I read the newspaper in the morning and a book on the way home. Still, I am easily distracted if someone – anyone – around me is talking or if there’s something slightly out of the ordinary happening, or about to happen. I always carry a small notebook with me and jot down the things I see and hear, usually to write about it later or to find a way to use it in something else I’m working on. When I don’t have a notebook, I write on the newspaper I’m reading, a bill I’m carrying in my bag or anything else I can get my hands on. As a result, I’ve accumulated quite a few observations, most of which are in small notebooks and on scraps of paper stuffed into a clear, plastic binder in my house. Since the onset of social media, I share most of my public transportation observations on Facebook but rarely expand upon them. Most times, the encounters are humorous, annoying or even slightly frightening. But riding the L every day for almost 20 years – and on occasion, for the two decades prior  – I’ve been able to witness plenty of pieces of goodness, those numerous small moments that make me realize that the beauty of public transportation isn’t always the gas saved, the money pocketed or the traffic avoided. It’s the idea of community, of sharing space with strangers from every walk of life. That’s what I love the most about the CTA, about public transportation – the daily interactions with others. I don’t know if I would change my worldview if I drove alone to work each day, but I know that what I see and hear on trains and buses certainly helps define my place in this city and my acceptance that I am just one of many.</p><p>This Monday, I got on the L at Harlem and sat across the aisle from a girl working on her algebra homework. An older woman entered at Jefferson Park – the next stop – sat next to the girl and saw her struggling with the problems. She asked if she could help, and proceeded to assist her the entire ride downtown. She told the girl that she usually got off at Clark and Lake but she didn’t care if she missed her stop because her boss didn’t care if she was late. As I was getting off the train at Jackson, the woman was giving the girl her phone number and email address, saying something along the lines of, “I have three sons but they’re all adults and out of the house. I really love math. It was my favorite subject in school. I just don’t get to do it anymore.”</p><p>Fast forward to this morning, four days later. I entered the train at Irving Park – two stops after Jefferson Park – and the woman and the girl were sitting together, working on math homework. This time, the woman got off the train at Clark and Lake, her regular stop, telling the girl, “See you tomorrow morning, third car from the back.”<em><em><em><em><em><em data-grid-id="b7592471-5ead-4f4e-b3de-45846c046c50">-Marco Buscaglia</em></em></em></em></em></em></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="17"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="19"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="20"><span data-reactid="21"><!-- react-empty: 22 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="23"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="24">CTA OFFERS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, HUMAN CONNECTION</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="27"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
